semaphore to solve critical section problem

Objectives

To understand process synchronization using
1>semaphore
2>busy waiting
3>spinlocks
4>monitors
5>critical section





















it will first take the and create a queue for storing  all those specified lenth for process

//for solving the process synchronization problem, i have create a integer variable called semaphore that has two values 0 or 1

//if semaphore values is 1,means shared resource is use by any process then other process will wait untill semaphore value become 0
//this is only implementation of semaphore rest of implemetaion we will upload soon...
